## API

![Production](https://github.com/bken-io/api/workflows/Master/badge.svg)

The api is written in golang and it is restful. It is deployed on digitalocean, proxied through cloudflare, and availible via https endpoints.

### Endpoints

https://bken.io/api

### Can I use it?

The api is not ready for developer integrations. Endpoints change frequently and the data model is not stable. We will adjust our stance as the site grows
